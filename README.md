# keyboard-quickfix

It is currently not possible to navigate through the QuickFix (CodeActions) popup.
For VIM users this really breaks the workflow.
This extension displays quick fixes in a quick open rather than in the menu.

The command to open the quick fix picker is:

- keyboard-quickfix.openQuickFix

The quick picker can be traversed with the following commands:

- workbench.action.quickOpenSelectNext
- workbench.action.quickOpenSelectPrevious
